# CLEAN NODE API

The purpose of this repository is to show an implementation of a Node.js API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and Design Patterns.

This API provides the ability for users to track their incomes and expenses.

Based on the [clean-ts-api](https://github.com/rmanguinho/clean-ts-api) repository by Rodrigo Manguinho.
